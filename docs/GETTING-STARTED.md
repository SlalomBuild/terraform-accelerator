<div style="font-family:monospace">
Terraform Adventure Version 1.0
<br/><br/>
You clicked on a link, and arrived a page that says "Terraform Accelerator". You have three options:
<br/><br/>

[Option 1: Use the accelerator to deploy infrastructre in one or more clouds](./project-setup.md)
<br/><br/>

[Option 2: Take part of the accelerator (for example, a component such as EKS) and use it on a different project](./using-parts-on-their-own.md)
<br/><br/>

[Option 3:  Learn about this accelerator, and the patterns and standards used](./patterns-and-practices.md)
<br/><br/>

[Option 4:  I want to demo the accelerator to a client, or include it in sales material](./sell-the-accelator.md)
<br/><br/>

Good luck!
